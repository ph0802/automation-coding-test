He will appreciate returning to this class and he will also enjoy the extra furling on offer. He is poised to bounce back into the money. INNERVOICE (9) finished runner up in her first three starts this prep before finishing a solid fourth at Dubbo last time out. She has really been hitting the line hard in her races and the step up in trip should be ideal. Christian Reith steps into the irons and the pair merit healthy respect. ISHIM (12) has been disappointing for a while now and must be running out of chances. The blinkers come off and she is worth including in all multiples at a price. LORD AVATAR (2) is very consistent and has changed stables since last racing. He has had three trials to get him ready for his return and a big effort is expected. Watch for him late.",
